The script Invivo-SingleUnit-Analysis.m performs an analysis of data collected using the Blackrock system, which is then spike sorted using the Plexon Offline Sorter. The data is saved as .nex files, and NeuroExplorer is used to open and export the data to MATLAB for the extraction of firing rates from individual units of each mouse. The script Summary_SingleUnits.m performs the final analysis of all units from all mice, including firing rates during the baseline and post-drug phases, the averages of these firing rates, and the directionality of changes in firing rates in response to the drug.
